# Repl-Customs Is Finally Here! 🎉
---

### What is Repl-Customs? 🤔

Repl Customs is a data solution I created to allow users to search the Replatabase for custom data solutions. ~~That doesn't answer anything but OK~~ You can find out answers to questions like, "*How many upvotes does my post get in an hour?*" or "*Who commented the most in the past week?*" Things like this are easy to look at with Repl Customs!

### The Current State of Things. 📈
Repl Customs is still in early development and the only real feature is looking up Repl users and getting a glorified profile page, but that is just the beginning! I want this to be a fully-fledged web app that is worth your time to visit. So look forward to constant updates and changes! I’ll be working on this for next few months.

### Want to Contribute? 📝
If this project piques your interest and you would like to contribute to this project as Repl user @adityaru first offered, anyone who wants to can read the guide and then open a pull request with your desired changes/updates! (*Right now there’s an issue with printing a comment’s post title to the web app, so if you have a fix for that please feel free to help out!*😀)

###### With all that said, please enjoy the first official release of Repl-Customs! 😎😎 🎉🎉
